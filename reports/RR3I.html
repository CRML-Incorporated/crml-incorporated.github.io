            <h1>[ 17/02/1778AxY - Portal First contact ]</h1>
            <p>The team decides to try to open the portal but due to insufficient amount of energy, we decided to delay it until we find a suitable source.<br><br>
                At around 14/02/1778AxY 12:33M we found a new type of element that contains enough energy to power the portal for around 30 minutes, we haven't had any idea for the name for this element yet.<br>
                We measured how much energy this element has by counting for how many radiation it emits.<br><br>
                At 15/02/1778AxY 5:12M, We started to build construction to house the radioactive element.<br>
                At 15/02/1778AxY 4:42N, We finished building and start to run some tests.<br>
                At 16/02/1778AxY 3:53M, Some of our employee that weren't nocturnal is now gone asleep so it slowed down our progress but we started to connect the power source to the portal main input.<br>
                At 16/02/1778AxY 10:34M, We had finished connecting and the portal is online but we haven't sure if it's safe to open yet.<br>
                At 16/02/1778AxY 11:23N, Few hours after we closed and locked everything in the portal lab, we detected a movement in Camera 2-PLAB, for some reason the footage of the camera was corrupted, we tried restoring it but our attempts were unsuccessful.<br>
                At 16/02/1778AxY 11:54N, The mysterious person or entity had managed to open the portal which causes a minor shake around the lab and nearby lands, we had sent securities and employees to investigate but the door was locked from the inside, whoever this person/entity is has access and known the password for the control panels.<br>
                At 17/02/1778AxY 12:04M, Axel reported that her daughter was missing, last seen at the Company Building.<br>
                At 17/02/1778AxY 1:03M, We got a report from our system that the portal had fully opened, it proves that the portal is working and functional but we still need further testing, whoever operating it does not know the consequences.<br>
                At 17/02/1778AxY 1:10M, The person/entity had gone inside the portal, but the doors are still locked, we are attempting to use the main security panel but the password has changed.<br>
                At 17/02/1778AxY 3:04M, The portal had ran out of energy and closed off, whoever is inside is now unable to go back. The portal is hard-coded to record every coordinates it sets too and we might be able to retrieve it.<br>
                At 17/02/1778AxY 8:44M, Orange-colored Fur was discovered near the incident and has been identified as the Fur of Caramell DaxiRelta also known as Axel's Daughter. Axel was in distraught upon finding out and now we are working our way to find this material again and re-open the portal to find his daughter before something even worse happens.<br>
